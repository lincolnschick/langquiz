# LangQuiz

LangQuiz is a website created to practice identifying languages based on their written form. It was designed with the game GeoGuessr in mind, and thus contains a large number of European languages. The complete quiz, user authentication, login, and sign up functionality is working (see below); however, the application is currently being rewritten in Next.js to learn and to add more features before being deployed.
